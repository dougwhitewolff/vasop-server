# Business Owner's Guide to Self-Service Voice Agent Setup

## 🎯 What This Platform Does

**In Simple Terms:**  
This is a website where you can set up your own AI-powered phone assistant in about 20 minutes - no technical knowledge needed. Your customers will call a phone number, talk to an AI assistant that sounds natural, and you'll get all their information via email.

**Just like how Superior Fence & Construction has Mason answering their calls, you'll have your own AI assistant with your business's personality!**

## 🔧 Common Questions

### "Can I test it before going live?"

**Yes!** After setup completes, click the "Test Your Agent" button. You can:
- Make a test call from your phone
- See a simulated conversation
- Make changes and test again

### "Can I change things after setup?"

**Yes!** Everything can be changed:
- AI personality and greeting
- Questions your AI asks
- Knowledge base documents
- Phone number
- Features on/off

Just log into your dashboard and click "Settings"

### "What if a customer asks something my AI doesn't know?"

Your AI will say:
> "That's a great question! I don't have that specific information right now, but I'll make sure our team follows up with you about that. Is there anything else I can help you with?"

Then in the email summary you get, it will note what the customer asked so you can follow up.

### "Can I use my existing business phone number?"

**Two options:**

**Option 1 (Recommended):** Keep your existing number and forward after-hours calls
- Example: Forward to your AI agent number after 6 PM
- Your phone company can set this up

**Option 2:** Replace your number completely
- Transfer your existing number to Twilio (takes 2-4 weeks)
- More complicated but possible

### "What if there's an emergency?"

You set this up in Step 4! When a customer:
- Presses the # key, OR
- Says "emergency"

The call is immediately forwarded to the phone number you specified.

### "How do I stop the service?"

Your customers will hear:
